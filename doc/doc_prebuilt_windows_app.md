### **Prebuilt Windows Releases**

Windows builds with all dependencies included are released regularly. Only the NVIDIA GeForce display driver needs to be installed. Prebuilt DeepFaceLab, including GPU and CPU versions, can be downloaded from [Mega](https://mega.nz/#F!b9MzCK4B!zEAG9txu7uaRUjXz9PtBqg) or [BitTorrent](https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=75318742)  (magnet link inside).
